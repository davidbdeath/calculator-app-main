## My process
I started by planning out how to do the theme switcher first, then put everything into the html and styled it.
Then i figured out how to use JS to check `prefers-color-scheme` and adjust accordingly.
Then I disabled smart zoom on ios and did input validation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to style radial buttons and theme switch using javascript.
